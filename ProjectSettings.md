# Project Settings #

---

## The environment ##
  * Qt 4.8.1 win32
  * Visual Studio 2010
  * Win7 64bit as test platform

## Why use qmake ##
Obviously, you can't work with a Visual Studio solution file under Ubuntu or Mac OS X. For cross-platform developing, makefile is the only way.

## How to setup ##
A .pro file will provide enough information for qmake generating .sln or makefile. The .pro is manually filled rather than auto-generated by qmake, to keep dependency clean.

  1. run the \Qt\bin\qtvars.bat to setup environment variables
  1. in the src folder, run the _qmake_
  1. open vcproj with VS and build it

  * The qtvar.bat is necessary for invoking qmake.
  * If you are using Windows, it generates VS project file.
  * If you are using non-Windows, it gives a makefile corresponding to your compiler and platform.
  * See qmake manual to change the makefile generating.

## Known issues ##
_Intel Amplifier_ will crash any Qt executable on QApplication::exec() under my environment. Reasons are unknown.
